    "readme": "[very alpha!] TaskAgent is the pursuit of Kaizen in software. It inverts the human-agent relationship: instead of humans directing coding agents, coding agents request human input when needed. It acts as an assistant PM, keeping coding agents busy and productive. It has two core responsibilities:"

  "_documentation": "This file contains context about your repository for TaskAgent.\n\nSECTIONS:\n- auto: Auto-generated by running 'npx tsx scripts/generate-repo-summary.ts'\n        DO NOT edit this section manually - it will be overwritten.\n\n- manual: Edit these fields to provide domain knowledge that cannot be\n          automatically detected. This helps TaskAgent ask better questions\n          and generate more relevant code.\n\nMANUAL SECTION FIELDS:\n- domainConcepts: Explain key business concepts, domain terminology, and\n                  business rules that agents should understand.\n                  Example: \"Users can have multiple 'workspaces'. Each workspace\n                  has 'projects' and 'tickets'. Tickets go through states:\n                  backlog -> in_progress -> review -> done.\"\n\n- architectureNotes: Describe key architectural decisions, patterns used,\n                     and why certain approaches were chosen.\n                     Example: \"We use event sourcing for audit trails.\n                     All mutations go through the command bus in src/commands/.\"\n\n- apiEndpoints: Document key API routes and their purposes.\n                Example: \"POST /api/tickets - Create new ticket (requires auth)\n                         GET /api/tickets/:id - Get ticket details\"\n\n- dataModels: Describe important data models and their relationships.\n              Example: \"Ticket has: title, description, state, assignee.\n                       State is a foreign key to WorkflowState.\"\n\n- conventions: Document code conventions not captured by linters.\n               Example: \"Use 'handle' prefix for event handlers.\n                        Use 'build' prefix for factory functions.\"\n\nWHEN TO UPDATE:\n- Run the generator script after major dependency changes\n- Edit manual sections when adding new features or changing domain logic\n- Review and update when onboarding new team members"
